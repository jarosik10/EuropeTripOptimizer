# Europe Trip Optimizer
Live: https://jarosik10.github.io/EuropeTripOptimizer/  
## Description
A website that allows you to select the capitals of European countries you want to visit, and calculate the optimal route for the planned trip.
Information on the individual distances between capitals is provided by [Openrouteservice Matrix API](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/matrix/).
The [Ant Colony Optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) is used for the route optimization.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
